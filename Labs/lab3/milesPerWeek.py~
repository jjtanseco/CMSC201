# Description: In this lab, we make a program that asks how much you drive to work each week, and the program tells 
#  you how many miles you drive and how much time you spend on the road each week.
# Collaboration: During lab, collaboration between students is allowed, 
# although I understand I still must understand the material 
# and complete the assignment myself.
